mehl
==============

python scripts that check against the meh.com api for the daily deal
--------------

Not much to see here yet.  Early development of modules tested as working.
Can initiate a connection with the API, extract the json data and convert
an HTML template with releveant deal data.  Deal data is inserted into an smtp message and can be sent to a recipient.
