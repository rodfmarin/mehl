         "body":"Generic aspirin? Sure, it's the same active ingredient. Generic potato chips? For you, whatever, eat what you dig. If company's coming over, serve the name brand. Generic trash bags? It only takes one catastrophic rupture to make that 79 cents' savings seem like a rip-off. \r\n\r\nWell, we thought generics were in that they'll-be-more-or-less-fine category. But when we see over 300 comments on [a thread about a battery sale](https://meh.com/forum/topics/aa-or-aaa-alkaline-batteries-48-pack), we know either something very, very good has happened - or something very, very bad. The generics weren't fine.\r\n\r\nHey, let's not relive that all over again. Let's just have a moment's peace here with a battery brand we trust: Energizer. Oh, wait a minute: Eveready. No, no, hang on, it's Eveready *by* Energizer. So *two* brands we trust. And they throw \"Gold\" in there, the commodity most trusted by investors, cable TV news viewers, and leprechauns. So they're double-extra trusty. No reason for anyone to complain.\r\n\r\nAnd that's what we really need right now. Just some peace and quiet. We still believe the perfect generic AA battery is out there somewhere. But today, we're spelling \"DRAMA\" without AA."
